# createDeck(ncards, suits) takes an integer, ncards, and a sequence,
# suits, and produces a new, cannonically ordered, ncards*len(suits)
# card deck, where the standard deck would have ncards=13 and the four
# default suits. Note that suits can be any sequence type, including a
# string, tuple, or list.
#
# A deck is implemented as a list of cards: each card is a tuple,(v,
# s), where 0 < v <= ncards is the (integer) value of the card and s
# is the (string) suit of the card. The list representing the newdeck
# is returned in the cannonical order (that is, ordered by suit, and
# within suit by card value).
#
# Example:
#   >>> createDeck(3)
#   [(1, ''), (3, ''), (2, ''), (1, ''), (3, ''), (2, '')]
#   >>> createDeck(1, 'AB')
#   [(1, 'A'), (1, 'B')]
#   >>> createDeck(4, 'A')
#   [(1, 'A'), (2, 'A'), (3, 'A'), (4, 'A')]
# The deck is always returned in cannonical order, defined above.
#
# Note: use a comprehension.

# scramble(D) takes a list, D, and modifies it to shuffle the order of
# the elements. There is a significant literature on constructing "fair"
# shuffles of a sequence; what we are after here is simple to
# implement but may not be entirely fair (for an example of a fair
# shuffling algorithm, see the Fisher-Yates-Knuth algorithm).
#
# scramble(D) steps through the input list starting with the last
# element and moving down. At each step, it randomly swaps the current
# element with itself (no change) or one of the elements that
# currently preceeds it in D. So, for example, on the third iteration,
# it randomly swaps element -3 with any element starting from 0 up to
# and including -3. The algorithm terminates after one downward sweep
# of the list, and returns the modified list. It should be obvious
# that the list we are likely to be scrambling in this homework is a
# deck from createDeck().
#
# Your code will need to use the randint() function, which has been
# imported for you from the random module at the top of this file
# (careful! unlike most Python functions, this function uses "inclusive"
# indexing: check the Python documentation).
#
# Note: you must modify D, not create new structure.

# dealTables(sizes, deck) takes a list of sizes and a deck (such as

# these representations by taking cards destructively from the deck
# and placing them in the appropriate sublist, or "table" in Trash
# terms.
#
# Since the input deck has been shuffled, it doesn't matter how you
# choose to deal the cards. You may choose to deal all of one player's
# table to their corresponding list at once, or you may choose to deal
# to each player in turn as is commonly done when playing cards. Do
# whatever is easier, remembering that as the game progresses, players
# will be dealt different numbers of cards on their respective tables.

# Note: Your code must destructively alter the deck to ensure no
# card is dealt to more than one person.

# unfilledTable(T) returns True if there are any unfilled slots in

# showTable(T) takes a list, T, representing some player's "table"
# (the cards laid out before him/her) and returns the printed
# representation as a string. Internally, a table is represented as a
# list of lists, where the length of the list corresponds to the size
# of the table, and the elements of the list (which are, themseleves,
# also lists) consist of two values, a Boolean (True if facing up,
# False if facing down) and a card (a tuple).
#
# So, a 3-element table with only the second element showing might
# look like:
#   [[False, (3, 'A')], [True, (2, 'C')], [False, (1, 'C')]]
# and we want the returned value to look like:
#   '  1[ ] 2[C2] 3[ ]'
# note the spaces, including the leading spaces, and the blanks for
# locations where cards that are "hidden" (i.e., have False as their
# first value).
#
# Here, we will make use of a "hidden helper function" showEntry(S)
# that takes a table location (again, a list of a Boolean and a card)
# and returns either a blank character (if the Boolean is False) or a
# string representing the card at that location (if the Boolean is
# True).

# playTurn(c, T) takes a card, c, and applies it to the specified
# table, T, returning the last unplayed card.
#
# Recall that in Trash, a turn involves drawing a card, and then using
# it to replace hidden cards on the table. The hidden cards are then,
# in turn, used to represent other hidden cards until no more
# replacements can be made. At this point, the last unplayed card is
# discarded.
#
# playTurn(c, T) should continue to place cards on the table as long
# as the cards remain playable. This inolves (i) making modifications
# to T (destructive operations) to reflect a card being placed and the
# fact that it is now face up, as well as printing out messages
# describing the turn as it unfolds.
#
# Example:
#   >>> playTurn((3, 'B'), [[False, (3, 'A')], [True, (2, 'C')], [False, (1, 'C')]])
#   Playing B3 on location 3
#   Playing C1 on location 1
#   Discarding A3
#   1[C1] 2[C2] 3[B3]
#   (3, 'A')
# where the last (3, 'A') is the value returned and correponds to the
# card to be added to the discard pile.
#
# Note that, after this turn, the player's table will have been
# modified to read:
#   [[True, (1, 'C')], [True, (2, 'C')], [True, (3, 'B')]

# drawCard(deck, discard, size, T) is the function that actually makes
# the only decision a player needs to make: whether to draw from the
# deck or the discard pile. The arguments to drawCard() are deck,a
# list representing the remaining cards; discard, a list representing
# the discard pile; size, an integer representing the size of the
# (implicit) player's table; and T, a list representing the player's
# table's state (see playTurn() or showTable() for details).
#
# The decision is simple. If the last card in the discard pile can be
# played on table T (meaning the corrsponding location in T is a
# hidden card), then draw from the discard pile. Otherwise, draw from
# the deck. Your function should modify either the discard list or the
# deck list and it should return the corresponding card drawn from
# whichever of these is modified.
#
# Example:
#    >>> drawCard([(2, 'A'), (4, 'A'), (2, 'C')], [(1, 'A'), (5, 'C'), (3, 'B')], 3, [[False, (3, 'A')], [True, (2, 'C')], [False,(1, 'C')]])
#    Drawing B3 from discard
#    (3, 'B')
# where the (3, 'B') is the value returned, and the printed message is
# meant to inform the player of how the game is evolving. Note that
# in this case, the discard pile has been modified to yield:
#    [(1, 'A'), (5, 'C')]
# Another example:
#    >>> drawCard([(2, 'A'), (4, 'A'), (2, 'C')], [(1, 'A'), (5, 'C'), (2, 'B')], 3, [[False, (3, 'A')], [True, (2, 'C')], [False,(1, 'C')]])
#    Drawing C2 from deck
#    (2, 'C')
# Here, the deck is modified to yield:
#    [(2, 'A'), (4, 'A')]
# in both cases, cards are drawn from the end of the list.

#   nplayers = integer number of players (from signature)
